    <h2>Common Issues</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Port in Use?</h3>
    <p class="common error"> If the last message that appears in the CMD window is not <code>|INFO |[SERVER] Started.</code>, it did not start properly and it won't work with your game, you can scroll up and you might see "port in use" errors. The server uses multiple ports such as port 53 to run, which may be in use by another program and, in my experience, has caused trouble for me every time I've restarted or locked my computer.</p>
    <h3>How to fix it?</h3>
    <p class="common solved"> Run a cmd window as admin and type <code>stop sharedaccess</code>. It may say "The Network Sharing Service could not be stopped," if so, do this: Win+R, "services.msc", click on "name" and type "host" and you should find the Host Network service. Right click and click "stop." After doing this, you should now be able to disable sharedaccess. </p>
